Application Name = iWash
Application Description:


        This application will allow users to add their cloths to a database, either by description, picture, or both. There will be a mandatory field that has washing and drying instructions, this bing the meat of the application. Whenever you have dirty cloths you will go to that item and mark it as dirty, once enough items that have the same (or similar enough) washing instructions are marked dirty the app will let you know which ones to put in the same loads and exactly how to set either the washer or dryer. The application could also track your wearing habits and recommend outfits for the current weather, taking into consideration the clothes that are still clean. This app can drastically help the general population who, not only ignore washing instructions, but by and large don’t even know they exist. This makes a tedious task of sorting laundry by color, instructions, materials, and so on, a thing of the past.
